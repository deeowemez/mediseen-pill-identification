    The error you're encountering indicates that the `pyttsx3` library is trying to load the `libespeak.so.1` shared object file, but it cannot find it. This often happens when the required dependency for the `espeak` text-to-speech engine is not installed on your system or when the library is unable to locate the necessary files.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install the `espeak` package on your system. You can do this using your package manager. On a Debian-based system, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install espeak
   ```

   On other systems, you might use a different package manager or download `espeak` from its official website.

2. If the `espeak` package is already installed, but the issue persists, you may need to locate the `libespeak.so.1` file and set the appropriate environment variable to help the system find it. Use the `locate` command or similar to find the file:

   ```bash
   locate libespeak.so.1
   ```

   Once you find the file, you can set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the directory containing `libespeak.so.1`. Replace `/path/to/lib` with the actual path where `libespeak.so.1` is located.

   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libespeak.so.1:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


   After setting the environment variable, try running your Python script again.

If the issue persists, you may need to check the `pyttsx3` documentation or community forums for further assistance, as there might be additional configuration or troubleshooting steps specific to the library and your environment.
